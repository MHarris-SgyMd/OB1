# 22. `update_thought` and `delete_thought` — a captured mistake was permanent

Ported from `integrations/update-thought-mcp` and `delete-thought-mcp` as
migration 009 plus two tools (Linear SMD-927). The surface could write and read
but never correct or remove: a typo, a mis-captured secret, a duplicate the
fingerprint missed, all permanent through the documented interface.

**Two defects in the extension were fixed rather than ported.**

`update-thought-mcp` issues a plain UPDATE of content and metadata and **never
recomputes `content_fingerprint`**, leaving it describing text the row no longer
holds. Dedup then breaks in both directions: re-capturing the OLD text hits the
stale fingerprint and merges into the edited row, and capturing the NEW text
finds no match and creates a duplicate of it. Migration 003's entire purpose,
undone by one edit.

Its concurrency guard is also **a race**: it SELECTs `updated_at`, compares in
application code, then UPDATEs, so a writer committing in between causes exactly
the lost update `if_unchanged_since` exists to prevent. Here the comparison is a
predicate in the UPDATE's own WHERE clause.

Two things this fork needs that upstream has no equivalent for: a content change
replaces the `thought_chunks` from migration 007 — otherwise the search index
still describes the previous text, findable by words that are gone and not by the
ones that are there — and both tools are gated on write scope, so a read key does
not see them in `tools/list` at all.

The delete is **hard**, which is only defensible because migration 008 preserves
`previous_content` before the row goes. Without that it should have been a soft
delete, and the issue said so.

`capture_thought` now returns the new id. It did not before, which was invisible
until these two tools existed — an agent that captured a typo had no id to correct
it with and had to search for its own thought.

Refusals are results, not exceptions: `NOT_FOUND`, `STALE_READ` and
`DUPLICATE_CONTENT` come back as values with a message saying what to do, because
at the tool boundary a thrown error is indistinguishable from a fault.

A third defect, found reviewing rather than writing, and the worst of them: the
`if_unchanged_since` guard **refused every correct caller**. Postgres keeps
`timestamptz` to the microsecond and JavaScript's `Date` keeps milliseconds, so a
client reading `12:01:53.133566` and passing back `12:01:53.133` was told
`STALE_READ` on a thought nobody had touched. Both sides are now truncated to
milliseconds, at the cost of a sub-millisecond window in which two writers could
both pass — against a guard that otherwise refuses everything.

The original test could not have caught it: it asserted a refusal in a case where
there genuinely *had* been an intervening edit, so it passed while the guard was
refusing indiscriminately. `[5b]` now asserts that reading and immediately writing
back succeeds, and `[5c]` that two writers racing on the same `if_unchanged_since`
produce exactly one winner — the assertion that separates a real atomic guard from
upstream's read-then-write race, which passes any sequential test.

Two tooling gaps this shook out. `db/ci-parity.sh` **only ran the
Postgres-backed suites**, so `test-server`, `test-auth` and `test-thoughts` were
never part of the local gate — and three stale tool-count assertions in them
reached a pull request while this script reported all green. It now runs
everything CI runs, which is what it was always claiming to be. It also judged a
suite failed if its output contained `error:` anywhere — and a suite that tests error messages says
"tool error" in its own assertion labels, so `test-update-delete` was reported
failed while passing 27/27. It now reads the tally rather than the prose.
