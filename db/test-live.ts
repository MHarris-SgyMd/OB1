/**
 * test-live.ts — verify the migrations against a REAL Postgres server.
 *
 * test-schema.ts covers schema semantics using PGlite, which is genuine
 * PostgreSQL but runs in-process over WASM. Three things it structurally cannot
 * reach, and all three have already hidden a defect:
 *
 *   1. The migration runner. migrate.ts speaks to a server over TCP with Bun.sql.
 *      PGlite is not a server, so the ledger, --dry-run, --baseline and drift
 *      detection were entirely untested until this file existed.
 *
 *   2. Driver-level parameter binding. The double-encoding bug that migration 005
 *      now rejects is invisible to a test that writes SQL literals — it only
 *      appears when a client binds a JS value to a jsonb parameter. Bun.sql binds
 *      a JS string as jsonb_typeof = 'string', silently emptying metadata.
 *
 *   3. The real planner on a real index. Whether HNSW is actually chosen.
 *
 * Requires DATABASE_URL pointing at a Postgres 15+ with pgvector 0.8+, on a
 * database this file may freely modify. It DROPS and recreates the schema, so
 * `dropSchema` refuses any host that is not loopback unless
 * OB1_ALLOW_REMOTE_DB=1 is set — that refusal is the safety net, the variable
 * is the override, and the override is a thing you have to mean.
 *
 *   ./with-postgres.sh bun test-live.ts        # starts a throwaway container
 *   DATABASE_URL=... bun test-live.ts          # against a LOCAL one you already have
 *   OB1_ALLOW_REMOTE_DB=1 DATABASE_URL=... bun test-live.ts   # anything else
