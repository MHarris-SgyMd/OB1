/**
 * test-upgrade.ts — migrations applied INCREMENTALLY, onto a database with data
 * already in it.
 *
 * Every other suite calls `resetSchema`, which drops everything and applies all
 * ten from scratch against an empty database. That is the one situation a real
 * deployment is never in. A migration that silently only works on an empty
 * table — an ADD COLUMN with a NOT NULL and no default, an ALTER that a trigger
 * refuses, a CREATE OR REPLACE that reverts an earlier one — passes the entire
 * gate and fails the first time somebody upgrades.
 *
 * Migration 010 made that gap concrete: it adds a column to `thought_audit`,
 * which is append-only and enforced by a trigger, and its header claims the
 * existing rows "correctly read NULL". Nothing held that claim. This does, and
 * generalises it, so the next migration is covered before it is written.
