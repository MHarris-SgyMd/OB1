/**
 * test-thoughts.ts — the pure rules, tested directly.
 *
 * None of this had a test before, because none of it was reachable: index.ts
 * exports only its fetch handler, so asserting that `action_item` maps to `task`
 * meant booting a server, stubbing a model provider, and driving a capture over
 * JSON-RPC — per alias. Nobody was going to write seven of those, so nobody wrote
 * any, and the alias table has been shipping unverified since it was added.
 *
 * Needs no database and no provider.
