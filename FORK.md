# FORK.md — what diverges from upstream, and why

This is a fork of [NateBJones-Projects/OB1](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1)
(Open Brain). It is **not** a hard fork. Upstream is alive and we intend to keep
taking from it; this file exists so the delta stays small, legible, and easy to
rebase.

**What this fork is for:** running Open Brain without Supabase. Upstream assumes a
supabase.com project — hosted Postgres, an Edge Function, SQL pasted into a
dashboard, `supabase secrets set`. This fork runs the same six MCP tools and the
same schema on infrastructure you control.

There is **no Supabase project to migrate from** here; this was built as a
greenfield alternative, not a data migration. Nothing in this fork moves rows out
of Supabase, and there is no cutover step. **Start at [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md).**

The upstream Supabase path still works and is untouched — `server/` is the
original Deno Edge Function build. Read this file before changing anything there.

## The pin

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream baseline | `9543c29a3e44a210ce278392b9fac11248997461` |
| Upstream date | 2026-08-30 |
| Git tag | `upstream-pin-9543c29` |
| Patch branch | `siggymd/fork-baseline` |

Upstream publishes **no releases and no tags** — there is no stable version to
track, and the setup guide has users `curl` `main` straight into production. The
tag above is our substitute for a release: it is the exact upstream tree our
patches apply to.

**Never deploy from upstream `main`.** Deploy from this branch.

### Deploying

For a non-Supabase deployment, see [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) — that is the intended
path. The rest of this section covers deploying the original Supabase Edge
Function build, which is still supported.

The upstream guide tells you to fetch `server/index.ts` from `main`, unpinned:

```bash
# DON'T — this is whatever is on upstream main at that moment
curl -o supabase/functions/open-brain-mcp/index.ts \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/main/server/index.ts
```

Deploy from a checkout of this fork instead:

```bash
git checkout siggymd/fork-baseline
cp server/index.ts server/deno.json supabase/functions/open-brain-mcp/
supabase functions deploy open-brain-mcp --no-verify-jwt
```

### Required migration

`db/migrations/004_upsert_thought_with_embedding.sql` must be applied for
the atomic capture path. Without it `capture_thought` still works — it falls back
to the old two-step write and logs a warning — but you keep the failure mode the
migration exists to remove. Apply the whole set with `cd db && bun migrate.ts`.

## What we changed

Seventeen commits on top of the pin. Seven fix defects found in an audit of the pinned
tree; the rest are migration work — a runtime-neutral build (Phase 3), the core
schema as applicable migrations (Phase 1), and a swappable data layer (Phase 2).

| # | Commit | What | Upstream status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `[fork] server: align stateless test…` | The only core-server test asserted HTTP 401 for auth failure; the server has returned HTTP 200 + a JSON-RPC `-32001` envelope since upstream PR #243 (2026-05-22). The test passed while encoding the opposite of production. | **Unfiled** |
| 2 | `[fork] server: pin test deps…` | `deno.json` pinned exact; `package.json` used carets with no lockfile, so tests ran against different library versions than the deployed function. | **Unfiled** |
| 3 | `[fork] server: paginate thought_stats…` | Reported a corpus-wide total beside aggregates computed from only the first 1000-row Supabase page. | [Issue #470](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/issues/470), open |
| 4 | `[fork] server: stop extractMetadata swallowing…` | No `r.ok` check; an expired API key produced a "successful" capture tagged `uncategorized`. | **Unfiled** |
| 5 | `[fork] server: …capture atomically` | Row committed first, embedding attached by a second call. A failure between left a thought stored but invisible to semantic search. | **Unfiled** ([PR #122](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/122) closed as out of scope) |
| 6 | `[fork] docs: make fingerprint setup re-runnable…` | Core setup and `recipes/content-fingerprint-dedup` shipped the same unguarded DDL, so following both in order errored. Plus three links to paths that do not exist. | **Unfiled** |
| 7 | `[fork] ci: run the tests…` | Upstream invokes no test from any workflow. Adds fork CI and a repo-wide consistency checker; fixes the 14 metadata violations it found. | **Unfiled** |
| 8 | `[fork] server-portable: runtime-neutral build` | New parallel `server-portable/` targeting Bun, Node, Cloudflare Workers and Deno Deploy. Two changes from `server/index.ts`: no Deno globals, and env read lazily. Its test suite **imports the real server**, so the drift class the guards detect cannot occur. | **Unfiled** |
| 9 | `[fork] db: core schema as applicable migrations` | The core schema existed only as prose in `docs/01-getting-started.md`. `db/migrations/` makes it executable, idempotent and versioned, with the Supabase-isms removed and a runner. Verified against real PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector via PGlite — 49 assertions, no daemon needed. | **Unfiled** |
| 10 | `[fork] db: live suite against a real Postgres server` | PGlite cannot reach the migration runner, driver-level jsonb binding, or the planner. Adds `test-live.ts` plus `with-postgres.sh` (podman first) and a CI service container. | **Unfiled** |
| 11 | `[fork] server-portable: swappable data layer` | Phase 2. Every DB call goes through `ThoughtStore`; `store-sql.ts` talks to Postgres directly via `Bun.sql`, `store-postgrest.ts` keeps the old path for cutover and for Workers. Verified end to end over MCP with no Supabase present. | **Unfiled** |
| 12 | `[fork] deploy: preflight gate and a full stack with no Supabase` | Phase 4. A misconfigured server used to start, answer the handshake, pass every liveness probe and fail on first real use. `preflight.ts` gates the container entrypoint; `deploy/compose.yaml` runs Postgres + migrations + server with no Supabase CLI; `smoke.sh` verifies any deployment over MCP. | **Unfiled** |
| 13 | `[fork] compat: a supabase-js-shaped client that speaks SQL` | 54 non-core files call PostgREST across 33k lines. Rather than rewrite them, `compat/supabase-sql` reimplements the ~20 methods they use, so 24 migrated by changing one import. Refuses resource embedding, nested `.or()`, type-only imports and `.auth`/`.storage` rather than faking them. | **Unfiled** |
| 14 | `[fork] server-portable: named, scoped, hashed access keys` | Replaced one shared plaintext key with `name:scope:sha256` entries, timing-safe comparison, and independent revocation. A read-scoped key does not merely fail to write — `capture_thought` is never registered for it, so it is absent from `tools/list`. `keygen.ts` mints them. Legacy `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` still works, with a preflight warning. | **Unfiled** |
| 15 | `[fork] db + server: the embedding contract is configurable` | `vector(1536)` was hard-coded in four migrations. Migrations are now templates, `OB1_EMBEDDING_DIM`/`OB1_EMBEDDING_MODEL` choose the pair, the choice is recorded in `ob1_config`, and preflight fails on a mismatch. Catches `text-embedding-3-large` at 3072, which exceeds pgvector's HNSW limit and would silently make every search a full scan. | **Unfiled** |
| 16 | `[fork] server: the model provider is configurable, including fully local` | Both per-capture calls (embedding, metadata extraction) now go to `OB1_LLM_BASE_URL` with `OB1_EMBEDDING_MODEL` and `OB1_METADATA_MODEL`; the credential is omitted for a loopback endpoint. A `local-models` compose profile runs Ollama so nothing about a captured thought leaves the host. | **Unfiled** |
| 17 | `[fork] evals: choose the local models by measurement` | The local defaults were picked by size. `evals/` benchmarks retrieval and extraction against real Ollama; `nomic-embed-text` placed 5th of 7 and `llama3.2` reproduced its production faults. Defaults are now `embeddinggemma` + `qwen2.5:7b`. | **Unfiled** |

`recipes/lint-sweep`, `recipes/weekly-digest` and `extensions/professional-crm`
are deliberately **unmodified** — their violations were resolved by widening
`.github/metadata.schema.json` instead, so the contributor credit and env-var
manifests they carry survive a rebase untouched.

`server/index.ts` is the only file where a conflict is likely to need thought.
It has changed **9 times in upstream's entire history** and not since June.

### Drift guards

The Node test suites cannot import `server/index.ts` (it reads `Deno.env` at
module scope and imports from `jsr:`), so they mirror its logic. A silent mirror
is exactly how fix 1's bug happened, so **every suite under `server/` opens with a
drift guard** that reads `index.ts` as text and fails if the behaviour it asserts
is no longer what the server implements. Each guard was verified against the
pre-fix source.

If you change `server/index.ts`, expect the guards to tell you. That is the point.

`server-portable/` needs none of this. Its env is read lazily, so `test-server.ts`
imports the server and asserts against the running handler — there is nothing to
drift from. That is the strongest argument for eventually making it the primary
build.

### 18. Long captures stay searchable — `thought_chunks`

A capture longer than the provider's per-request batch was embedded only in part.
The text was stored whole and `fetch` returned it whole, but `search_thoughts`
could not find the note by anything said in its second half — silently, with no
error on either the write or the search. Measured: a 4000-token note whose
conclusion is in its final sentence was retrieved at chance.

Migration 007 adds `thought_chunks`, and `capture_thought` now splits content
above `OB1_CHUNK_TOKENS` (1200) into overlapping windows and embeds each. Notes:

- **`thoughts` is untouched** — no new columns, so the core guard rail holds — and
  existing rows keep working with no re-embedding. Chunks are extra evidence, never
  a replacement.
- **Short thoughts write no chunk rows at all.** Both corpora measured in `evals/`
  average under 500 tokens, so the common case pays nothing.
- For chunked content `thoughts.embedding` becomes the *first chunk's* vector, not
  the whole content's. Embedding the whole thing would be an over-batch request,
  which Ollama answers by silently truncating — reintroducing the bug in the one
  column pre-existing rows and the PostgREST path still depend on.
- `match_thoughts` searches both tables and deduplicates to one row per thought,
  scored by its best evidence. Each side takes its own indexed top-K rather than
  scoring every row, because the obvious formulation cannot use an HNSW index.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so a deleted thought cannot leave orphan vectors still
  answering searches.

`server-portable/test-chunking.ts` asserts the case that used to fail, with a stub
provider that *refuses* over-batch input rather than truncating it, so removing
chunking fails loudly instead of quietly regressing. Measured for real in
`evals/eval-chunking-e2e.ts` — the actual server against actual Ollama and
Postgres — where documents of ~4.6K and ~9.2K tokens go from 1/4 (chance) to 4/4.

Two gaps this closed on the way. The PostgREST store had **no test at all**, so
its RPC argument shapes were unverified until chunking added a fourth one;
`test-store-postgrest.ts` now covers it using `compat/supabase-sql` as the
fixture. That immediately found a real bug in the shim: a numeric array bound to a
`vector` parameter became a Postgres array literal, which pgvector rejects, so
**every** `.rpc()` call passing an embedding through the shim was broken.

## Checking CI on this fork

Two traps, both of which cost real time.

**`gh` defaults to the parent repo.** In a fork, `gh run list` resolves to
`NateBJones-Projects/OB1` and reports nothing for our branches, which reads exactly
like "no runs" rather than "wrong repository". Fix it once per clone:

```bash
gh repo set-default MHarris-SgyMd/OB1
gh run list --branch siggymd/db-migrations          # now the fork
```

Eight commits went out on a red CI because of this. Only `Fork Checks` ever runs
here; the other eleven inherited workflows are PR- and issue-triggered against
upstream and never fire on a branch push.

**Running the suites individually cannot catch state leaking between them.**
`db/with-postgres.sh` starts a fresh container per invocation, so anything one
suite leaves behind is invisible; CI reuses one Postgres service across every
step. That difference hid a real failure: `DROP TABLE thoughts CASCADE` removes the
foreign-key constraint on `thought_chunks`, not the table, so a stale chunk table
survived at the previous suite's vector width and the next suite died on a
dimension mismatch. Every suite now drops `thought_chunks` first, and

```bash
./db/ci-parity.sh
```

runs them all in CI's order against one shared database. Use it before pushing.

### 19. Default embedding model → `qwen3-embedding:4b` at 1024 dimensions

Measured best on a real corpus: 0.933 MRR against `embeddinggemma`'s 0.914 over 97
real issues, and the only local model that embeds a long capture whole. Costs ~3x
the embedding latency and 2.5 GB.

**This is a breaking change for an existing install.** The width moves from 768 to
1024, so it needs a schema migration and a re-embed of every row. `preflight.ts`
refuses to serve against a mismatch rather than letting search quietly degrade, so
an install that skips this fails loudly. Staying put is a supported choice — set
`OB1_EMBEDDING_MODEL` and `OB1_EMBEDDING_DIM` explicitly and nothing changes.

Two things had to be built first, and the second is why this was not a one-line
change:

- **Truncation is now automatic for known-MRL models.** `qwen3-embedding:4b` is
  2560 dimensions natively, above pgvector's 2000 HNSW ceiling, so the default
  would otherwise refuse every capture. `OB1_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` still defaults
  to off for anything not in `MRL_MODELS` or of unknown native width — the opt-in
  exists to stop silent truncation of models never trained for it, and that
  property is unchanged.
- **Asymmetric prompting.** Qwen3-Embedding is trained to see queries and
  documents differently, and the server had one code path for both. Prompted it
  scores 0.933; bare, **0.860** — worse than the model it replaces. Switching the
  default without this would have been a regression dressed as an upgrade.
  Templates live in `db/config.mjs` keyed by model, so changing model changes
  prompt and preflight's existing model-change check already covers it.
  `embeddinggemma` gains 0.002 from its own format and nomic's prefixes measurably
  hurt, so neither is listed — the table is per-model, not global.

`scripts/check-fork-consistency.mjs` now fails if `deploy/compose.yaml`'s
`${VAR:-fallback}` values drift from `db/config.mjs`. Compose substitutes those
before the process starts, so a stale fallback silently overrides the code default
rather than deferring to it.

### Considered and not built: a second retrieval tier

An LLM reranker over the embedding search's top-5, escalated only when the cosine
margin says tier 1 is unsure. Measured well when tier 1 was `embeddinggemma`:
86% → 91% Recall@1 on 97 real issues, five queries fixed, **none broken**.

Re-measured after the default moved to `qwen3-embedding:4b@1024`, it no longer
justifies itself. Tier 1 alone now reaches 90%, the reranker adds three points
rather than five, and it is no longer regression-free — against a stronger embedder
it demotes a correct answer, because it sometimes knows less than the embedder
does. Worse, `qwen2.5:7b` in that role takes Recall@1 *down* two points, so the
feature is only correct with an 18 GB model resident alongside the embedder.

Three points for a 15x latency increase and a footgun is not a default. The
harnesses stay (`evals/eval-cascade.ts`), so a corpus that behaves differently can
re-derive it. Full numbers in `evals/README.md`.

### The recurring defect in this fork: a value defined twice

Worth naming, because it has now caused five separate failures and every one
looked different on the surface:

| what was duplicated | how it failed |
| --- | --- |
| embedding prompts (harness vs `config.mjs`) | benchmark measured an instruction the server never sends |
| truncation rule (`index.ts`, `preflight.ts`, `config.mjs`) | container crashlooped on a valid default |
| schema reset across 9 test files | stale `thought_chunks` broke a later suite in CI only |
| compose `${VAR:-fallback}` vs `config.mjs` | a stale fallback would silently override the code default |
| **preflight's own copy of the defaults** | **the gate validated a configuration that was never going to run** |
| `applyPrompt` (server vs `evals/lib.ts`) | introduced *while fixing* this same pattern, one commit earlier |

The last one is the worst of them and survived until a deliberate look for it.
`preflight.ts` exists to refuse to serve when misconfigured, and it held its own
`"openai/text-embedding-3-small"` and `1536`, so after the default moved it checked
`text-embedding-3-small @ 1536` while the server ran `qwen3-embedding:4b @ 1024`.
Invisible in the container, because compose sets every one of those explicitly.

The last row is the instructive one: it was introduced one commit after this
section was written, by the person who wrote it, in a commit whose subject was
removing duplication. Naming a pattern does not stop you repeating it — only a
check does, which is why the row above it is now enforced by
`scripts/check-fork-consistency.mjs` rather than by intent.

The pattern is consistent enough to be a rule: **a default that appears in two
files will be wrong in one of them, and the copy that goes stale is the one nobody
runs directly.** Everything provider-facing now resolves through `db/config.mjs`,
and `scripts/check-fork-consistency.mjs` fails the build when compose, the
embedding model, the metadata model and the base URL stop agreeing.

The same rule applies to the suites. Three of them read a shipped default instead
of pinning their own, so changing the default broke tests that were testing
something else entirely — `test-e2e-sql` matched a provider by the literal string
`openrouter.ai`, `test-preflight` hardcoded `1536`, `test-embedding-dimensions`
keyed a stub off exact input text. A suite should pin what it does not test.

### 20. Shared scaffolding, and pure logic lifted out of `index.ts`

A refactor pass over code this fork owns entirely — `server-portable/`, `db/`,
`evals/`, `compat/` are all new directories, so none of this can conflict on a
rebase. It found two live defects before it removed a line, which is recorded
above; what follows is the extraction itself.

**`db/test-support.ts`** — `dropSchema()`, `applyMigrations()`, `resetSchema()`,
`createAssert()` with `skip()`, and `requireDatabaseUrl()`. Nine suites had their
own schema reset, eleven their own counting assert. Drop and apply are separate
exports because `db/test-live.ts` only drops (it applies later, since `migrate.ts`
is what it tests) and `test-preflight.ts` asserts the un-migrated state in between
— two steps beat an option that exists for one caller. `dropSchema()` owns a
function list as well as a table list, which closed a latent bug: `test-live` had
never dropped the 4-argument `upsert_thought` migration 007 added, so its reset
left one behind, masked by `CREATE OR REPLACE`.

**`server-portable/test-support.ts`** — the MCP client five suites carried,
including the SSE fallback that is easy to omit when copying and only fails on
transports that use it.

**`evals/lib.ts`** — the spec grammar (`model[!bare|!gemma][@dims]`), prompt
application, the embedding call and cosine. Four harnesses had their own `embed`
and were sending **three different query instructions**, none of them the server's.
Since the same model scores 0.938 prompted and 0.860 bare, that made their numbers
incomparable to each other as well as to production.

**`server-portable/thoughts.ts`** — `normaliseType`, `thoughtTitle`, `thoughtUrl`.
Extracted for testability, not size: `index.ts` exports only its fetch handler, so
these were reachable only by booting a server, stubbing a provider and driving a
capture over JSON-RPC, once per case. Nobody writes seven of those to check an
alias table, so nobody wrote any — the table had been shipping unverified since it
was added, and it exists because llama3.2 really did return `action_item`.
`thoughtUrl` now takes its base as an argument instead of reading the environment,
which is what lets the file be tested without one. `test-thoughts.ts` adds 40
assertions and needs neither database nor provider.

**Not split:** the six `registerTool` blocks are 430 of `index.ts`'s remaining 947
lines. They are schema plus handler, cohesive, and already driven end to end over
MCP. Splitting them would be motivated by a line count.

**The codebase got slightly bigger, not smaller**, and it is worth being straight
about that. Measured across the five refactor commits, excluding markdown:

| | added | removed | net |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| existing suites and harnesses | 103 | 487 | **−384** |
| new shared modules and tests | 467 | 9 | **+458** |
| | | | **+74** |

So 384 lines of duplication genuinely left the callers, and 458 arrived in five new
files — of which 79 are `test-thoughts.ts`, coverage that did not exist before, and
much of the rest is the comments explaining why each helper is shaped as it is. A
line count was never the case for this: the case is that adding a table to the
schema used to mean nine edits and now means one, and that four harnesses can no
longer disagree about what prompt they send.

Every suite reports exactly the count it reported before the pass — 63, 30, 37, 30,
31, 15, 13, 10, 21, 61, plus 43, 41 and the new 40 — which is the only check that
means anything when the thing being refactored is the tests.

One process note, since it cost four reverts. Regex-over-the-file replacement
failed three times: twice by over-matching into unrelated code, once by silently
not matching and leaving dead code beside an unused import. What worked every time
was line-anchored — locate the declaration, walk to its boundary by brace column,
assert the span contains nothing unexpected, and refuse the file otherwise.

### 21. Every mutation is recorded — `thought_audit`

Ported from `schemas/thought-audit` as migration 008 (Linear SMD-926). Nothing
recorded who changed what, and audit only ever describes events that happened
after it existed — so every capture made before this was permanently
unattributed. That asymmetry is why it is core rather than an extension.

Three departures from the extension, each a correctness fix rather than a
preference:

- **Append-only is enforced by a trigger, not by grants.** Upstream grants
  `SELECT, INSERT` to `service_role` and withholds `UPDATE`/`DELETE`. That works
  on Supabase, where the application role does not own the table. Off Supabase
  the application owns the schema, and **an owner's privileges cannot be
  revoked** — so the grant approach would have offered no protection while
  appearing to. A `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger refuses both for every role.
- **No RLS, no `service_role`**, consistent with migration 004's precedent and
  with what `db/test-schema.ts` already asserts.
- **The audit row is written inside the mutating transaction.** Upstream
  describes audit writes as "fire-and-forget… failures here never block the main
  operation", which for an audit log means silently losing the events it exists
  to record. A trigger on `thoughts` cannot fail separately from the mutation,
  and it covers every path in — including the tools SMD-927 will add.

The actor reaches the trigger on a transaction-local setting (`ob1.actor`, set
with `set_config(..., true)`), carrying the access key's *name* from `auth.ts`.
Transaction-local rather than session-level so it cannot leak to the next request
on a pooled connection — `test-audit.ts` asserts that directly. `actor_name` is a
first-class column rather than a key in `actor_context` so SMD-928 can promote it
to a canonical id: promoting a column is a migration, promoting a JSON key is
archaeology.

`thought_id` is deliberately not a foreign key, so audit rows outlive their
subject — the delete event being the one most worth keeping.

The actor rides in `p_payload`, which has been an **envelope** since migration
004 — that function reads only `p_payload->'metadata'` and ignores every other
key — so `p_payload.actor` needed no new overload and works identically on both
stores. The first version set the setting from `store-sql.ts` alone, which left
every audit row written through PostgREST with a NULL actor: present, plausible,
and wrong. `test-store-postgrest.ts` now asserts attribution on that path, and
that the actor does not leak into the thought's own metadata.

Redefining `upsert_thought` from a later migration has one trap worth naming:
`CREATE OR REPLACE` takes the whole body, so **every change made to it in
between is silently reverted**. Writing 008 without migration 005's
payload-validation guard dropped it, and `db/test-schema.ts` caught it on the
next run. Anything redefining that function again must carry both 005's guard
and 008's actor setting forward.

Two things a second review pass caught, both the same shape — the feature
working while quietly doing the wrong thing:

**A duplicate re-capture was logged as an update that changed nothing.** The
fingerprint dedup exists so a bulk re-import is idempotent, and a re-capture of
identical content takes the `ON CONFLICT` branch, moving `updated_at` and nothing
else. That wrote one audit row per duplicate with an empty diff, so re-running a
10,000-thought import produced 10,000 rows saying nothing happened — unbounded
growth on the operation designed to be repeatable, and a log too noisy to answer
the question it exists for. The trigger now returns early when the diff is empty:
`updated_at` moving alone is bookkeeping, not history.

**`preflight.ts` reported OK on a database with no audit table.** Captures
succeeded and went unrecorded, and the only symptom was history that never
existed. Now a `fail`, matching how migration 004's absence is treated — and it
checks the *trigger*, not the table, because the table alone would pass while
nothing wrote to it. Serving unaudited for a week is a week that cannot be
reconstructed, which is worse than a crashloop because it is invisible.

One incidental finding, recorded because it changed the implementation: **Bun's
Postgres client returns the `HINT` field as UTF-16 bytes with interleaved nulls**
(`"T\0o\0 \0p\0r\0u\0n\0e\0…"`). Guidance put in `USING HINT` is unreadable to
the runtime this server uses, so it lives in the exception message instead. A
hint nobody can read is worse than none, because it looks like it worked.

## Detached from the fork network

This repository was forked from `NateBJones-Projects/OB1` and then detached, for
one concrete reason: on a fork, GitHub's "New pull request" targets the **parent**
by default, so a mis-click puts internal work into a public PR on someone else's
repository. Detaching removes that. It also stops `gh` resolving to the parent,
which hid a red CI for eight commits (see above).

**Nothing about the upstream relationship in git changed.** The `upstream` remote,
the pin at `9543c29`, and the rebase procedure below all work exactly as before —
detaching is GitHub metadata, not history. Provenance stays recorded here and in
`LICENSE.md` (FSL-1.1-MIT, which is unaffected: internal use is permitted, and the
Competing Use restriction is unchanged by where the repo sits).

One consequence to know about. Fork status had been suppressing the
`pull_request_target`, `issues` and `schedule` triggers, which is the only reason
upstream's eleven workflows were dormant. Detaching makes them live —
`ob1-gate-v2.yml` would fail every internal PR by enforcing contribution rules
this fork deliberately does not follow, and `update-readme-contributions.yml`
runs on a cron with `contents: write` and rewrites the README on `main`.

The plan was to disable them at the repo level, keeping the files byte-identical
to the pin so rebases stayed clean. **That is not possible.** GitHub creates a
workflow record on first run, so a workflow that has never run cannot be disabled:
the API returns 404 and `gh workflow list` does not see it. Waiting until after
the first run means accepting whatever that run does — for the scheduled one, an
unattended bot commit to the default branch.

So all eleven are deleted, from `main` and from the working branch. Only
`fork-checks.yml` remains. `.github/disable-upstream-workflows.sh` is kept for the
case a rebase reintroduces one **and** it has already run, which is the only
situation where disabling works.

Removing them from `main` is safe because nothing reads our `main`: the pin is held
by the annotated tag `upstream-pin-9543c29`, and the procedure below rebases onto
`upstream/main` from `siggymd/fork-baseline`.

## Rebasing onto upstream

Roughly quarterly, or when something lands that we want.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline upstream-pin-9543c29..upstream/main -- server/ docs/01-getting-started.md

git checkout -b siggymd/rebase-$(date +%Y%m%d) siggymd/fork-baseline
git rebase upstream/main

cd server
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun test-stateless.mjs && bun test-stats-pagination.mjs && bun test-capture-atomicity.mjs
deno check --node-modules-dir=none index.ts   # --node-modules-dir=none is required
                                              # once the line above has created
                                              # server/node_modules
cd ../server-portable
bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun test-server.ts && bunx tsc --noEmit
bun run test:sql && bun run test:e2e            # needs podman or docker
bunx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=.cf-out   # Workers target still builds
cd ../db && bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun test-schema.ts
./with-postgres.sh bun test-live.ts               # needs podman or docker
cd .. && node scripts/check-fork-consistency.mjs

git tag -a upstream-pin-$(git rev-parse --short upstream/main) \
  -m "Upstream main @ $(git rev-parse upstream/main)"
```

Then update the pin table at the top of this file.

### Landing a rebase on `main`, which is protected

`main` is the working default and carries a ruleset: nine required status checks,
no deletion, **no force-push**, and no bypass actors — it applies to admins too.
That is deliberate, and it interacts with a rebase in one specific way.

A rebase produces `siggymd/rebase-YYYYMMDD` with **rewritten history**, so it
cannot fast-forward onto `main`. Two ways forward:

**Open a pull request (normal case).** Required status checks mean **no push
directly to `main` succeeds**, merge commit or not — a push carries commits CI has
never seen, so the rule cannot be satisfied:

```
remote: - 9 of 9 required status checks are expected.
```

That is not a quirk of the merge; it is what requiring checks means. Everything
reaching `main` goes through a PR, which is two commands:

```bash
gh pr create --fill --base main --head siggymd/rebase-$(date +%Y%m%d)
gh pr merge --merge --auto        # lands itself once the nine checks pass
```

History keeps both lines, which is what happened when the fork's work first landed
on `main`, and is the right default: the rebase is a reconciliation, not a
replacement.

**Reset `main` to the rebased line (rare).** Only if you want `main`'s history to
*be* the rebased history — cleaner, but it discards the record of how the fork
diverged. This is a force-push and the ruleset will refuse it:

```
remote: - Cannot force-push to this branch
```

To do it anyway — as with any push that must bypass the checks — set the ruleset
to `disabled`, push, and put it back:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/MHarris-SgyMd/OB1/rulesets/22189960 -f enforcement=disabled
git push --force-with-lease origin main
gh api -X PUT repos/MHarris-SgyMd/OB1/rulesets/22189960 -f enforcement=active
```

Prefer `--force-with-lease` over `--force` so a push that raced with someone else's
is refused rather than silently discarding it.

**Nothing forces the rewrite.** The pin is held by the annotated tag
`upstream-pin-<sha>`, not by any branch, so `main`'s history never has to be
rewritten to record where upstream was. Reach for the merge.

**Drop a patch rather than carry it** if upstream fixes the same defect. Check
issues #470 and #216 first — both are open with volunteers waiting, so fixes 3
and possibly the auth work may arrive upstream.

### Why we do not send these upstream

`CONTRIBUTING.md:268` lists modifying "the core MCP server" as an automatic
reject, and [PR #122](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/122) was
closed on exactly that basis:

> The main change edits the core MCP server, which is explicitly out of scope for
> community contributions in this repo… If we want this behavior upstream, it
> needs to come through a focused maintainer-led path instead.

Fixes 1–5 all live in `server/index.ts`. Fixes 6 and 7 are contributable in
principle; note that [issue #482](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/issues/482)
reports the upstream PR gate currently fails on **every** fork-originated PR.

## Known issues we did NOT fix

Deliberate. Recorded so nobody assumes they were missed.

- **The access key still rides in the URL** — but it is now scoped, named and
  hashed (fix 14). `?key=` is kept because Claude Desktop connectors are URL-only,
  so a key in a URL still reaches access logs and browser history. What changed is
  what a leak is worth: a read-scoped key cannot write, and `capture_thought` is
  not even registered for it. Upstream
  [issue #216](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/issues/216) and
  [PR #238](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/238) (OAuth 2.1) remain
  the real fix. **Still treat a connection URL as a credential**, and give
  URL-embedded clients read scope.
- **The upstream PR gate can be bypassed with a title.** A PR titled `[docs] …`
  (or touching no contribution directory) exits before the credential scan runs.
  Only matters if we start accepting PRs into this fork.
- **`claude-issue-triage.yml`** feeds untrusted issue bodies to an agent holding
  `issues: write`; **`discord-announce.yml`** declares no `permissions:` block.
  Neither is reachable in a fork that has those workflows disabled.
- **Three overlapping dashboards** (`open-brain-dashboard`, `-next`, `-pro`) with
  different auth and env models. Nothing says which is canonical. Pick one before
  depending on any.
- **`sensitivity-tiers` does not exist.** Both Next dashboards, the
  `weekly-digest` recipe and its code reference it as a primitive.
  [PR #110](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/110) was closed
  pending a consolidation that never landed. Any feature gated on it is inert.
- **`server-portable` has not served a live `workerd` request.** The Cloudflare
  target is verified with the real bundler (252 KiB gzipped) and CI rebuilds it on
  every push, but no request has gone through `workerd` end to end. Smoke-test a
  real deploy before relying on it.
- **Two suites still test mirrors.** `server/test-stats-pagination.mjs` and
  `server/test-capture-atomicity.mjs` need a stubbed Supabase client, which the
  lazy `db()` accessor makes easy to inject but which is not built. Until then they
  keep their drift guards.
- **The eval sample is small.** Twenty retrieval queries and eight extraction
  captures. Differences under ~0.05 MRR, or one point of a per-field score, are not
  meaningful; the clear separations (the long-document slice, the structural
  failures) are. The test sets also reflect one person's kind of notes.
- **The local path is verified against real Ollama** (0.33.2, `nomic-embed-text` +
  `llama3.2`): `preflight --deep` passes, including `llama3.2 honours JSON mode`,
  and real thoughts capture and retrieve with no external service. Two caveats
  remain: Ollama was installed **natively** (Homebrew), because a Linux container
  on Apple Silicon gets no Metal passthrough and runs inference on CPU — the
  compose `local-models` profile is for Linux hosts and CI. And a container
  reaching a host-native Ollama needs `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` plus
  `OB1_LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.containers.internal:11434/v1`, since Ollama binds
  loopback by default.
- **The 24 shim-migrated files are not individually tested.** Most need live
  credentials (Gmail, Slack, Readwise). The shim itself has 61 assertions against
  real Postgres, and CI checks every migrated file still parses and that the
  codemod round-trips byte-for-byte — but exercise the ones you actually run
  before trusting them.
- **Seven files still need a human.** Four use PostgREST resource embedding (a
  join), two use nested `.or()` grouping, and one is a type-only import. Run
  `node scripts/migrate-to-sql-shim.mjs` for the current list and the reason.
- **`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` disagree** — a duplicated worktrees block, then
  divergent content, and `AGENTS.md` mandates updating a private tracker.
  [PR #274](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/274) proposed the
  obvious fix, was endorsed in review, and was closed unmerged.

## Before this touches anything sensitive

Two constraints that are not engineering problems.

**Data.** Open Brain's model is one static bearer key in a URL, one shared
`thoughts` table with no per-user isolation, and every captured thought sent to
OpenRouter for LLM metadata extraction. That is fine for personal notes. It is
not an architecture to put regulated or patient-adjacent data into, and no patch
in this series changes that.

**Licence.** FSL-1.1-MIT, © Nate B. Jones. "Your internal use and access" is an
explicitly Permitted Purpose, so a private fork for internal tooling is squarely
allowed. A **Competing Use** — making it available to others in a commercial
product with the same or substantially similar functionality — is not. Each
version converts to MIT two years after upstream publishes it. Fine as internal
tooling; get a legal read before any of it ships in a product.
