# FORK.md — what diverges from upstream, and why

This is a fork of [NateBJones-Projects/OB1](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1)
(Open Brain). It is **not** a hard fork. Upstream is alive and we intend to keep
taking from it; this file exists so the delta stays small, legible, and easy to
rebase.

Read this before changing anything under `server/`.

## The pin

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream baseline | `9543c29a3e44a210ce278392b9fac11248997461` |
| Upstream date | 2026-08-30 |
| Git tag | `upstream-pin-9543c29` |
| Patch branch | `siggymd/fork-baseline` |

Upstream publishes **no releases and no tags** — there is no stable version to
track, and the setup guide has users `curl` `main` straight into production. The
tag above is our substitute for a release: it is the exact upstream tree our
patches apply to.

**Never deploy from upstream `main`.** Deploy from this branch.

### Deploying the Edge Function

The upstream guide tells you to fetch `server/index.ts` from `main`, unpinned:

```bash
# DON'T — this is whatever is on upstream main at that moment
curl -o supabase/functions/open-brain-mcp/index.ts \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/main/server/index.ts
```

Deploy from a checkout of this fork instead:

```bash
git checkout siggymd/fork-baseline
cp server/index.ts server/deno.json supabase/functions/open-brain-mcp/
supabase functions deploy open-brain-mcp --no-verify-jwt
```

### Required migration

`server/migrations/001-upsert-thought-with-embedding.sql` must be applied for
the atomic capture path. Without it `capture_thought` still works — it falls back
to the old two-step write and logs a warning — but you keep the failure mode the
migration exists to remove. Apply it in the Supabase SQL Editor.

## What we changed

Eight commits on top of the pin. Seven fix defects found in an audit of the pinned
tree; the eighth adds a parallel runtime-neutral build without touching `server/`.

| # | Commit | What | Upstream status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `[fork] server: align stateless test…` | The only core-server test asserted HTTP 401 for auth failure; the server has returned HTTP 200 + a JSON-RPC `-32001` envelope since upstream PR #243 (2026-05-22). The test passed while encoding the opposite of production. | **Unfiled** |
| 2 | `[fork] server: pin test deps…` | `deno.json` pinned exact; `package.json` used carets with no lockfile, so tests ran against different library versions than the deployed function. | **Unfiled** |
| 3 | `[fork] server: paginate thought_stats…` | Reported a corpus-wide total beside aggregates computed from only the first 1000-row Supabase page. | [Issue #470](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/issues/470), open |
| 4 | `[fork] server: stop extractMetadata swallowing…` | No `r.ok` check; an expired API key produced a "successful" capture tagged `uncategorized`. | **Unfiled** |
| 5 | `[fork] server: …capture atomically` | Row committed first, embedding attached by a second call. A failure between left a thought stored but invisible to semantic search. | **Unfiled** ([PR #122](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/122) closed as out of scope) |
| 6 | `[fork] docs: make fingerprint setup re-runnable…` | Core setup and `recipes/content-fingerprint-dedup` shipped the same unguarded DDL, so following both in order errored. Plus three links to paths that do not exist. | **Unfiled** |
| 7 | `[fork] ci: run the tests…` | Upstream invokes no test from any workflow. Adds fork CI and a repo-wide consistency checker; fixes the 14 metadata violations it found. | **Unfiled** |
| 8 | `[fork] server-portable: runtime-neutral build` | New parallel `server-portable/` targeting Bun, Node, Cloudflare Workers and Deno Deploy. Two changes from `server/index.ts`: no Deno globals, and env read lazily. Its test suite **imports the real server**, so the drift class the guards detect cannot occur. | **Unfiled** |

### Files we own

Rebase conflicts will only ever come from these:

```
server/index.ts                  # fixes 3, 4, 5
server/package.json              # fix 2
server/bun.lock                  # fix 2
server/test-stateless.mjs        # fix 1
server/test-stats-pagination.mjs # fix 3   (new file)
server/test-capture-atomicity.mjs# fix 5   (new file)
server/migrations/               # fix 5   (new dir)
.github/metadata.schema.json     # fix 7   (3 additive optional fields)
.github/workflows/fork-checks.yml# fix 7   (new file)
scripts/check-fork-consistency.mjs # fix 7 (new file)
server-portable/                 # fix 8   (new dir — parallel, does not touch server/)
docs/01-getting-started.md       # fix 6
recipes/content-fingerprint-dedup/README.md  # fix 6
recipes/email-history-import/README.md       # fix 6
recipes/gmail-smart-pull/README.md           # fix 6
dashboards/open-brain-dashboard-next/README.md # fix 6
integrations/open-brain-rest/metadata.json   # fix 7
recipes/world-model-diagnostic-activation/metadata.json # fix 7
skills/world-model-diagnostic/metadata.json  # fix 7
```

`recipes/lint-sweep`, `recipes/weekly-digest` and `extensions/professional-crm`
are deliberately **unmodified** — their violations were resolved by widening
`.github/metadata.schema.json` instead, so the contributor credit and env-var
manifests they carry survive a rebase untouched.

`server/index.ts` is the only file where a conflict is likely to need thought.
It has changed **9 times in upstream's entire history** and not since June.

### Drift guards

The Node test suites cannot import `server/index.ts` (it reads `Deno.env` at
module scope and imports from `jsr:`), so they mirror its logic. A silent mirror
is exactly how fix 1's bug happened, so **every suite under `server/` opens with a
drift guard** that reads `index.ts` as text and fails if the behaviour it asserts
is no longer what the server implements. Each guard was verified against the
pre-fix source.

If you change `server/index.ts`, expect the guards to tell you. That is the point.

`server-portable/` needs none of this. Its env is read lazily, so `test-server.ts`
imports the server and asserts against the running handler — there is nothing to
drift from. That is the strongest argument for eventually making it the primary
build.

## Rebasing onto upstream

Roughly quarterly, or when something lands that we want.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline upstream-pin-9543c29..upstream/main -- server/ docs/01-getting-started.md

git checkout -b siggymd/rebase-$(date +%Y%m%d) siggymd/fork-baseline
git rebase upstream/main

cd server
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun test-stateless.mjs && bun test-stats-pagination.mjs && bun test-capture-atomicity.mjs
deno check --node-modules-dir=none index.ts   # --node-modules-dir=none is required
                                              # once the line above has created
                                              # server/node_modules
cd ../server-portable
bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun test-server.ts && bunx tsc --noEmit
bunx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=.cf-out   # Workers target still builds
cd .. && node scripts/check-fork-consistency.mjs

git tag -a upstream-pin-$(git rev-parse --short upstream/main) \
  -m "Upstream main @ $(git rev-parse upstream/main)"
```

Then update the pin table at the top of this file.

**Drop a patch rather than carry it** if upstream fixes the same defect. Check
issues #470 and #216 first — both are open with volunteers waiting, so fixes 3
and possibly the auth work may arrive upstream.

### Why we do not send these upstream

`CONTRIBUTING.md:268` lists modifying "the core MCP server" as an automatic
reject, and [PR #122](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/122) was
closed on exactly that basis:

> The main change edits the core MCP server, which is explicitly out of scope for
> community contributions in this repo… If we want this behavior upstream, it
> needs to come through a focused maintainer-led path instead.

Fixes 1–5 all live in `server/index.ts`. Fixes 6 and 7 are contributable in
principle; note that [issue #482](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/issues/482)
reports the upstream PR gate currently fails on **every** fork-originated PR.

## Known issues we did NOT fix

Deliberate. Recorded so nobody assumes they were missed.

- **The access key rides in the URL.** `?key=<64-hex>` is the documented
  connector string, it is one key for core *and* every extension, the function
  deploys `--no-verify-jwt` so it is the only auth, and CORS is `*`. Query
  strings land in access logs, shell history, and config files.
  [Issue #216](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/issues/216) covers it;
  [PR #238](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/238) proposes OAuth 2.1
  upstream. Fixing it properly means changing the auth model, not patching a
  line — out of scope for this series. **Treat the connection URL as a
  credential and the Supabase request logs as sensitive.**
- **The upstream PR gate can be bypassed with a title.** A PR titled `[docs] …`
  (or touching no contribution directory) exits before the credential scan runs.
  Only matters if we start accepting PRs into this fork.
- **`claude-issue-triage.yml`** feeds untrusted issue bodies to an agent holding
  `issues: write`; **`discord-announce.yml`** declares no `permissions:` block.
  Neither is reachable in a fork that has those workflows disabled.
- **Three overlapping dashboards** (`open-brain-dashboard`, `-next`, `-pro`) with
  different auth and env models. Nothing says which is canonical. Pick one before
  depending on any.
- **`sensitivity-tiers` does not exist.** Both Next dashboards, the
  `weekly-digest` recipe and its code reference it as a primitive.
  [PR #110](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/110) was closed
  pending a consolidation that never landed. Any feature gated on it is inert.
- **`server-portable` has not served a live `workerd` request.** The Cloudflare
  target is verified with the real bundler (252 KiB gzipped) and CI rebuilds it on
  every push, but no request has gone through `workerd` end to end. Smoke-test a
  real deploy before relying on it.
- **Two suites still test mirrors.** `server/test-stats-pagination.mjs` and
  `server/test-capture-atomicity.mjs` need a stubbed Supabase client, which the
  lazy `db()` accessor makes easy to inject but which is not built. Until then they
  keep their drift guards.
- **`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` disagree** — a duplicated worktrees block, then
  divergent content, and `AGENTS.md` mandates updating a private tracker.
  [PR #274](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1/pull/274) proposed the
  obvious fix, was endorsed in review, and was closed unmerged.

## Before this touches anything sensitive

Two constraints that are not engineering problems.

**Data.** Open Brain's model is one static bearer key in a URL, one shared
`thoughts` table with no per-user isolation, and every captured thought sent to
OpenRouter for LLM metadata extraction. That is fine for personal notes. It is
not an architecture to put regulated or patient-adjacent data into, and no patch
in this series changes that.

**Licence.** FSL-1.1-MIT, © Nate B. Jones. "Your internal use and access" is an
explicitly Permitted Purpose, so a private fork for internal tooling is squarely
allowed. A **Competing Use** — making it available to others in a commercial
product with the same or substantially similar functionality — is not. Each
version converts to MIT two years after upstream publishes it. Fine as internal
tooling; get a legal read before any of it ships in a product.
